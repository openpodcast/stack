# Open Podcast Stack

This is a collection of tools and services that can be used to create a
standalone Open Podcast Analytics Stack.

## Usage

Get started by using the [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file
in this repository:

```bash
make up
```

This will start the entire stack and make it available on your local machine.
